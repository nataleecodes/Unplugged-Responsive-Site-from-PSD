# Why CSS Media Queries?
Each layout here was set up using a hand-coded media query in CSS, based on designs in a PSD file. This was a learning exercise to help me understand viewports. I have used Flexbox and Bootstrap in other site layouts, soon to be uploaded to new repositories. Jan 2018 goal: learn CSS Grid!
