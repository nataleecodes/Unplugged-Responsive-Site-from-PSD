# "Unplugged" Responsive Music Reviews Site
A responsive webpage coded from scratch based on Photoshop PSD files from a designer. 

Features: 3 layouts - mobile, tablet, desktop. 

Try resizing your browser window to see the three layouts, live, here: [https://nataleecodes.github.io/unplugged-responsive-site/](https://nataleecodes.github.io/unplugged-responsive-site/).

Note: Each layout here was set up using a hand-coded media query in CSS. This was a learning exercise. I have used Flexbox and Bootstrap in other site layouts, soon to be uploaded to new repositories. Jan 2018 goal: learn CSS Grid!
